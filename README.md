A Short Course in Photography: Film and Darkroom (9th Edition) by Barbara London,Jim Stone Book Review

Name: J. L. Washington
Rating: 1.0 out of 5 stars
Title: The Kindle version of this book reads differently
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on October 4, 2014
Review: I just downloaded the Kindle version of this book for my photography class. I have just begun to read the book, so I cannot address its contents. I am giving this book only 3 stars because of its formating on the Kindle. Unlike every other Kindle book I have ever downloaded and/or purchased, this book appears to be a simple PDF version of the orginal book. With other Kindle books that I have, I can resize the text on whatever device I am using, and the text automatically conforms to that device, to make reading a breeze, no matter the device and font size I select. With this book, however, each page is exactly like a PDF page, which is a camera-ready copy of the printed page. You can zoom in and out, but it is like zooming in and out of a PDF page. So, if you are like me, someone who requires larger print in order to read the book (that's why I purchased the kindle version instead of the printed version), this book is VERY difficult to use and almost totally useless. If you zoom in to make the print larger, it is like zooming in to a smaller part of the page. You must then use the arrow keys to move over the page (just like a magnifying glass over a page, and just like you would zooming into a PDF page). Once you have laboriously used the cursor keys to laboriouisly move over the page, you must then move to the next page, and then do it all over again. I STRONGLY recommend that you DO NOT purchase the Kindle version of this book, especially if you require larger print. It is too difficult to read, easpecially if you have any vision problems and/or wish it to read like other traditional Kindle books. The ONLY reason I would consider recommending this book is because it is cheaper than the printed version. If you are buying for your class only, then I recommend renting it instead of buying it like I did. You will save about $20. In summary, the Kindle version of this book SUCKS with a CAPITAL SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Review Update: First of all, the content in this book is OUTSTANDING! It is possibly the perfect book for beginners to photography. The only problem I have with the book is that it doesn't work properly like other Kindle books. When I wrote my review, I was using the Kindle app for my Macbook Pro. I then looked at this book again using the Kindle app for iPad. While I do have the same problems on my iPad that I do on my Mac, the iPad version does allow me to use the two finger zoom in & out, and I can use one finger to easily hover over the page (up, down, right, left, and Diagon Ally). The lesson here is that not all versions of the Kindle app are the same. The iPad version operates so much better than the Mac or PC verson. I was going to return this book, but the iPad version of the Kindle reader does make it easy enough to read the book (but still not like other books), so I will definately keep this awesome book. After looking at the book more closely, I think the reason the publisher had to publish the book this way is because there are so many graphics that the traditional way would not work. In most books, there is a lot of text with an occasional picture or diagram, which you can click on to enlarge. The layout of this book is in a 3 column format, which automatically makes the book easier to read. Therefore, I am changing my review from 1 star to 4 stars. Also, I have traditional Kindle reader, but have not tried it on their yet. Considering how graphical this book is, I seriously doubt that this book will read well, if at all, on a traditional Kindle (i.e. Kindle touch or Kindle DX). I'm sure this book will read well on the Kindle Fire or Kindle Fire HD.

Update 2:
I have this book loaded on my MacBook Pro and iPad. I then tried to load it onto my Lenovo Thinkpad X200 Tablet (convertable from PC to Tablet). Guess what? When I tried to load and read the book on my ThinkPad (because I read on all three devices), the publisher says that I have downloaded it too many times. I have NEVER had this problem on any other book that I have ever purchased. I spent full price for this book, and I can't put it on any whichever devices that works for me. That SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Therefore, my rating of this book now falls to a 1 (0 if it was an option). ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. THE PUBLISHER OF THIS BOOK SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I bought this book because my class required it. If you are not in a class that requires this book, then I would STRONGLY recommend a book from another author and/or publisher.

Title: NOT an Ebook; does not have Kindle format, and does not offer the perks of Kindle format, like sizing the text, searching, etc!
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on August 28, 2016
Review: The Kindle Ebook version of this is NOT in Kindle Ebook format. It is unreadable even with magnifying glasses on my 7" FireHD because the text can only be resized by resizing THE ENTIRE PAGE. NONE of the normal ebook functions can be used, such as sizing the text, changing the page colors for different reading environments, or searching the book for specific information. It was sold as a Kindle Ebook on the first page, then on the actual order page, it is described as an "Etextbook". Save yourself the trouble and just find a text copy used. More cr@p straight from the shelves of the multi-billion dollar corporation, Pearson Labs, most frequently described on my campus as "the multi-billion dollar company who invests NOTHING in product quality and relies on schools selling their wares to unsuspecting buyers who have no option."
